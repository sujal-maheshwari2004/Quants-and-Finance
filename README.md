# Quants and Finance 📊

This repository is a growing collection of **quantitative finance** concepts implemented in **Python**.  
Each folder in the repository focuses on a *specific topic* in finance, markets, or quantitative analysis.

The goal of this project is to **learn, experiment, and document** financial ideas using code — from market basics to more advanced quantitative methods.

## 🧠 What This Repository Is About

Quantitative finance applies:
- Mathematics
- Statistics
- Programming
- Data analysis

to solve problems in:
- Financial markets
- Asset pricing
- Risk management
- Trading strategies
- Fixed income and derivatives

This repository serves as a **personal knowledge base and practice ground** for these ideas.

## 📂 Repository Organization

- Each **folder represents one topic** in quantitative finance
- Topics are independent and may vary in depth and complexity
- New folders will be added over time as new areas are explored

Examples of topics may include (but are not limited to):

- Stock market fundamentals  
- Bonds and fixed income  
- Time series analysis  
- Financial mathematics  
- Trading logic and simulations  
- Data analysis and visualization  

> There is **no fixed or final structure** — the repository evolves organically as learning progresses.
